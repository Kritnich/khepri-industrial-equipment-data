Following contact with the outside world and the enhancement of their already-established industrial base, the Rubbleborn decided to use existing frames as testbeds. The Bombardier came out of this program as a specialized mining tool, using corrosive acids to break apart rocks where other machines could more easily clear a path. It proved to be so effective that it soon became standard-issue for all mining operations run by the Rubbleborn, and several have made their way into the hands of the Jovo Extraction Conglomerate as a gesture of goodwill.</p>",
